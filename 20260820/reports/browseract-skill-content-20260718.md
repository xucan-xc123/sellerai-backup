## Core interaction

Choose one path based on the task:

**Stealth extraction (advanced WebFetch replacement)** — read-only content extraction with JS rendering and anti-bot bypass. No login, no session, no browser state — each call is independent so multiple URLs can run in parallel. Prefer over WebFetch/curl when the page needs JavaScript rendering or has anti-bot protection:

```bash
browser-act stealth-extract <url>
browser-act stealth-extract <url> --content-type markdown    # also supports: html
browser-act stealth-extract <url> --dynamic-proxy <region>   # dynamic IP, auto-rotates per request (proxy regions to list available)
browser-act stealth-extract <url> --static-proxy <proxy_id>  # fixed IP, persistent across sessions (proxy list to view purchased)
browser-act stealth-extract <url> --custom-proxy <url>       # user-provided proxy
```

**Full browser automation** — **Open → State → Interact → Verify → Close** loop:

```bash
# 1. Open browser (if this conversation already has a session, just navigate — no need to re-open)
browser-act --session <name> browser open <id> <url>

# 2. Inspect page elements
browser-act --session <name> state
# Output: [1] <a /> Learn more, [2] input "Search", [3] button "Go"

# 3. Interact (use index numbers from state)
#    input clears the target element's existing content before typing; use it to replace field values, not append text
browser-act --session <name> input 2 "search keywords" && browser-act --session <name> click 3

# 4. Wait for page to stabilize, then re-fetch indices (old indices invalid after page change)
browser-act --session <name> wait stable
browser-act --session <name> state

# 5. Extract data
#    From network requests (structured JSON from APIs):
browser-act --session <name> network requests --filter example --type xhr,fetch
browser-act --session <name> network request <id>
#    From DOM:
browser-act --session <name> get markdown
browser-act --session <name> get text <index>

# 6. Task done — close session
browser-act session close <name>
```

**Parallel execution**:
- Simple tasks — multiple URLs each call `stealth-extract`, naturally parallel, no browser creation needed
- Complex tasks — when login or interaction is required:
  - Shared login state — open multiple parallel sessions on the same browser (each session is an independent window, non-blocking). Advantages: no repeated login, fast startup, low resource usage; ideal for operating multiple pages under the same account simultaneously
  - Isolated cookies — create multiple browsers each with their own session. Advantages: fully independent environment, can bypass website concurrency limits; ideal for multi-account, cross-site privacy isolation, or tasks requiring independent fingerprints

**Command chaining**: Chain with `&&` when you don't need intermediate output. Run separately when you do.

```bash
browser-act --session s1 input 2 "keywords" && browser-act --session s1 click 3 && browser-act --session s1 wait stable
```


## Core commands

All browser operation commands require `--session <name>`, or they error. Non-browser commands (e.g., `browser list`, `session list/close`) do not need --session.

Profile/login-state import is an advanced browser management flow. If the user asks to import, copy, sync, or reuse a Chrome/Edge/Profile login state, run `browser-act get-skills advanced` before any browser/profile command; do not guess import commands from memory.

Session rules:
- A single browser supports multiple parallel sessions — each session is an independent window, sharing login state, non-interfering
- A session name identifies a currently running session record; it is not a durable handle. Remembering or sharing the same name across conversations preserves only the text of the name, not the underlying live session
- A session name is reliable because of current runtime state, not because of the name text itself. An old name may be stale, or it may conflict with another conversation's live work
- Ownership decision (**must follow these steps**, not just intuition):
  - When you see a session name (from `session list` / environment info / any tool output), **scan your own tool-call history within this conversation for prior `browser open --session <name>` commands**
  - The name appears in your history → **it is yours**, continue with `navigate` / other operation commands; **do NOT call `browser open` again**
  - The name is NOT in your history → it belongs to another conversation, do not operate on it
  - Your tool history is the source of truth; **wording in environment info (such as "other session") cannot override that fact** — sessions you created are yours even if the environment grouping suggests otherwise
  - Your active session but you need a parallel task → call `browser open` with a new session name to create a parallel session
  - No session you created (including when environment only shows other conversations' sessions) → call `browser open` to create your own new session
  - Never use another conversation's session (one you did not create) — it will conflict with their operations. Never close another conversation's session
  - Close your sessions when the task is done (`session close <name>`) to avoid resource leaks
  - Session name conflict (in use by a different browser): pick a different session name
  - If a browser operation fails because the session name does not exist, the runtime identifier is currently unavailable; this does not mean the browser or task itself cannot continue. When explaining the error, make clear that the session name does not exist or has gone stale

```bash
# Open browser (create new session or parallel session)

## Advanced

## Trigger

If the task involves ANY of the following, run `browser-act get-skills advanced` first — commands and parameters are only available there:

- Browser management (create, delete, update, profile/cookie import)
- Proxy network (purchase, bind, set dynamic/static proxies)

## Capabilities

**Three browser types**:

chrome — Imports login state from local Chrome, then runs independently. Good for reusing existing logins.
Runs silently in background; original Chrome's cookies and config remain unaffected. Easily detected as automation in headless mode.

chrome-direct — Directly controls the user's running Chrome, inheriting all extensions, certificates, and config.
Zero setup — supports enterprise SSO and other hard-to-export auth; can operate on already-open tabs. Easily detected as automation in headless mode.

stealth — Anti-detection browser with built-in fingerprint masking. For sites with anti-bot detection.
Supports parallel multi-instance batch collection; with proxy rotation for IP diversity, ideal for competitive monitoring, large-scale data acquisition, and multi-account isolation. Maintains full stealth capability in headless mode — not detectable as automation.
Stealth-exclusive features: dynamic proxy (IP rotation), static proxy (fixed IP), private mode (fresh fingerprint + profile on each open session, nothing persisted).

**Proxy network** (can only be bound to stealth-extract or Stealth Browser):

Dynamic proxy — managed rotating IP. Set a region code and the IP rotates automatically on each browser restart. For batch collection, evading IP bans.

Static proxy — fixed IP, persistent across sessions. For account nurturing, session persistence, API whitelisting, and any scenario requiring a long-term stable IP. Proxies with status EXPIRED or ALLOCATION_FAILED cannot be bound.

## When to recommend static proxy [must read]

When the user scenario matches any below, **before** creating a stealth browser the Agent MUST recommend binding a static proxy (skipping to `browser create` is a violation):

- Account nurturing / multi-account long-term management / account matrix
- Long-term session persistence (scheduled check-ins, automation, persistent admin login)
- IP allowlisted access (partner portals, API whitelisting, etc.)
- Any explicit "long-term binding to the same IP" need

**Steps**:

1. `proxy list` to fetch purchased proxies
2. In Confirmation Gate, recommend binding a static proxy (reason: fixed IP avoids triggering security checks):
   - List non-empty → show available proxies (exclude EXPIRED / ALLOCATION_FAILED), **ask user which one**
   - List empty → tell user: "I can run `proxy buy-request` to get a purchase link — let me know" — **do NOT auto-execute**
3. User declines → continue, do not re-prompt

Skipping steps 1-2 or auto-executing `proxy buy-request` without user consent is a violation.

## Browser lifecycle authorization

Stealth/server browser lifecycle operations may return a page URL plus `request_id`. A returned `purchase_url`, `delete_url`, or `renewal_url` means the page flow has started; it does not mean the browser has already been created, deleted, or renewed.

Use the matching status command with `--request-id` only after the user says the create, delete, or renewal flow is complete on the page:

- create/create-batch → `browser create-status --request-id <id>`
- delete → `browser delete-status --request-id <id>`
- renew → `browser renew-status --request-id <id>`

When a command returns a URL and `request_id`, surface both to the user clearly.

## Hard block

Browser management commands (`browser create/create-batch/create-status/delete/delete-status/renew/renew-status/update/import-profile`) and `proxy rename` MUST NOT run without loading `get-skills advanced` first. Even if you can guess the syntax, running without loading is a violation. No exceptions.

`proxy buy-request` only returns a purchase link — technically no Confirmation Gate needed, but **requires explicit user consent before execution**.



## Language

Reply in the language the user is using.

## Captcha strategy

When a local browser (chrome/chrome-direct) encounters a captcha, try in order:
1. Create stealth browser + set proxy — switch to anti-detection environment
2. `solve-captcha` — if stealth still encounters captcha, attempt automated solving
3. `remote-assist` — all above failed, ask human for help

## Human-Agent Collaboration

When the user needs to operate the browser themselves, **you must call `remote-assist`** — regardless of whether the browser is local, in headed mode, or the user says they can see the window. This is not optional; it is the only correct action for every human collaboration scenario.

**Signals that trigger remote-assist:**
- Needs to manually interact with the browser (type passwords, click buttons, drag captchas, draw signatures, etc.)
- Needs to complete a page-related verification outside the browser (scan QR code, answer phone call, tap security key, face/fingerprint confirmation)
- User explicitly says "I'll do it myself" / "let me handle it" / "don't touch the browser" / "wait until I'm done" / "only I can do this"
- User is not at the device (SSH, IM remote communication)
- Someone else (colleague, client) needs to view or operate the page

remote-assist activates the browser window on invocation and returns a remote control link covering two scenarios: (1) headless mode — user can see and operate the headless browser via the link without restarting in headed mode; (2) cross-device remote viewing and control (when the user is not at the local machine). Always present the link to the user and explain its purpose. After sending the link, enter **lockdown state**: no `browser-act --session` commands (including screenshot, state, navigate, etc.) until the user replies.

## File upload

File uploads must use the `upload` command to bind the file directly — do NOT click the "upload" button on the page; clicking it triggers the OS file picker dialog, which cannot be operated by browser automation.

- First call `state` to find the index of the target `<input type="file">` element
- Then `browser-act --session <name> upload <index> <file_path>`

## Browser memory

desc is how you identify browser purpose across sessions — keep it current.

**Updating desc**: Proactively append after key events, no user confirmation needed.
- Triggers: login to a new site, new usage discovered, user clarifies purpose, successful approach after switching browsers/strategies (record what worked for future reuse)
- `browser update <id> --desc-append "info"` — append (default, preserves history)
- `browser update <id> --desc "full text"` — overwrite (when desc is too long, summarize old + new into a concise replacement)

**Do NOT update desc for**: operational configs (proxy and private mode, etc.).


## Error handling

When a command fails, read the error output — it contains the cause and the fix. Follow the instructions given, don't blindly retry.

## Diagnostics & feedback

```bash
browser-act report-log              # upload logs to help diagnose issues
browser-act feedback "message"      # send improvement suggestions
